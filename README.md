# Detection And Mitigation Of Replay Attacks
CCTV systems are vital for surveillance across sectors like banking, transportation, healthcare, and public safety. However, they face growing cyber threats, especially replay attacks, where intercepted video or data streams are retransmitted to deceive the system. This leads to unauthorized access, footage tampering, and compromised surveillance integrity, exposing the need for robust security enhancements. This project proposes an AI-based detection and response system to mitigate replay attacks by integrating machine learning and cryptographic security measures. Key components include: 
Secure Communication Protocols: Encrypting data and verifying stream authenticity. 
AI-Powered Anomaly Detection: Identifying timestamp and frame inconsistencies in video streams.
Real-Time Automated Response: Alerting admins, isolating compromised devices, and blocking threats.
Modular Design: Seamlessly integrating with existing infrastructures. The system undergoes vulnerability assessments, machine learning model training, and rigorous testing to ensure effectiveness, scalability, and ease of use. Expected outcomes include improved replay attack detection, enhanced CCTV security, and greater trust in surveillance technologies, making this a significant step towards adaptive, secure surveillance solutions.
